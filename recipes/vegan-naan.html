        <h4>The fluffiest vegan naan you will ever have the pleasure of tasting, courtesy of <a href="https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-naan/">Nora Cooks</a></h3>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>For this recipe, you will need:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
            <li>3/4 cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups all purpose flour, or white whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons coconut cream, *may omit if needed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>Optional: melted vegan butter for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Add the yeast and sugar to a large bowl and pour the warm water on top (think bath temperature, not too hot or it will kill the yeast). Let sit for a few minutes until it is frothy on top.</li>
            <li>Now add the flour, salt, baking powder, coconut cream and olive oil. Stir with a wooden spoon until it becomes difficult, then turn the ball of dough out on a lightly floured surface (I just use my countertop). Knead the ball of dough for about 2-3 minutes, until the ball of dough is smooth and soft. If it is too sticky, add a little more flour.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a large bowl, cover with a tea towel and let it rise for about 30 minutes. If you are in a hurry, you can skip the rising part. It will still come out quite good!</li>
            <li>After it rises, flatten the dough and divide into 8 pieces.</li>
            <li>Heat a large, heavy bottomed pan (cast iron preferred) over medium heat. Take a piece of the dough and roll it on a lightly floured surface into a circle or oval shape (about 1/4 inch thick). If using garlic, gently press a little minced garlic onto one side so it sticks at this point.</li>
            <li>Place the dough on the heated pan and cook until large bubbles have formed and the bottom is golden brown. Flip and cook 1-2 minutes more until that side is golden brown as well.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining pieces. Cover the naan with a towel or wrapped in foil to keep warm until ready to serve. Serve plain or brush with melted vegan butter and sprinkle with fresh herbs, such as cilantro or parsley.</li>
        </ol>
